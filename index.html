        <div class="information-container">
          <p class="information">
            Michael Gerard Tyson is an American former professional boxer who
            competed from 1985 to 2005. Nicknamed
            <strong>"Iron Mike"</strong> and <strong>"Kid Dynamite"</strong> in
            his early career, and later known as
            <strong>"The Baddest Man on the Planet"</strong>, Tyson is regarded
            as one of the greatest heavyweight boxers of all time.
          </p>

        <h2 class="section-heading">Early Life</h2>
        <div class="information-container">
          <p class="information">
            Michael Gerard Tyson was born on June 30, 1966, in Brooklyn, New
            York, to parents Jimmy Kirkpatrick and Lorna Tyson. When Michael was
            two years old his father abandoned the family, leaving Lorna to care
            for Michael and his two siblings, Rodney and Denise. Struggling
            financially, the Tyson family moved to Brownsville, Brooklyn, a
            neighborhood known for its high crime. Small and shy, Tyson was
            often the target of bullying. To combat this, he began developing
            his own style of street fighting, which ultimately transitioned into
            criminal activity. His gang, known as the Jolly Stompers, assigned
            him to clean out cash registers while older members held victims at
            gunpoint. He was only 11 years old at the time.<br /><br />

            He frequently ran into trouble with police over his petty criminal
            activities, and by the age of 13, he had been arrested more than 30
            times. Tyson's bad behavior landed him in the Tryon School for Boys,
            a reform school in upstate New York. At Tryon, Tyson met counselor
            Bob Stewart, who had been an amateur boxing champion. Tyson wanted
            Stewart to teach him how to use his fists. Stewart reluctantly
            agreed, on the condition that Tyson would stay out of trouble and
            work harder in school. Previously classified as learning disabled,
            Tyson managed to raise his reading abilities to the seventh-grade
            level in a matter of months. He also became determined to learn
            everything he could about boxing, often slipping out of bed after
            curfew to practice punches in the dark.

          </div>
          <p class="information">
            In 1980, Stewart felt he had taught Tyson all he knew. He introduced
            the aspiring boxer to legendary boxing manager Constantine "Cus"
            D'Amato, who had a gym in Catskill, New York. D'Amato was known for
            taking personal interest in promising fighters, even providing them
            room and board in the home he shared with companion Camille Ewald.
            He had handled the careers of several successful boxers, including
            Patterson and Jose Torres, and he immediately recognized Tyson's
            promise as a contender, telling him, "If you want to stay here, and
            if you want to listen, you could be the world heavyweight champion
            someday."
